## üîí Security Notes

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Change default PocketBase admin credentials
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Restrict access to PocketBase admin (port 8090)
- [ ] Regularly update API keys
- [ ] Monitor access logs
- [ ] Set up backup strategy for PocketBase data

### Recommended Security Settings

```bash
# Use environment-specific credentials
POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin-$(date +%s)@yourcompany.com
POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```
